That and other questions made me, and certainly the world we live in leads us to be self-taught, competition is latent, and having more than one skill makes a difference in getting a job or even a promotion, don’t you believe me? So let’s think about the most terrible thing that could happen, for example, if the only designer missed the job and at that moment the client who wants to show him the prototype of the application arrived, the project manager does not know what to do and all the responsibility falls on him, what would you do ?, maybe the Project Manager convinces him to come another day but the company would be losing reputation, another solution would be to show that you can expose the prototype, since you learned UI / UX design and thanks to your good performance against the problem you receive an increase or maybe you are the new Project Manager xd.

## Skills you should learn

Entering the field of mobile applications, I would tell you to start creating in your notebooks, it costs nothing to take a pencil or pen and model interfaces, do it as you like, be free and let your imagination flow.

To capture the wireframes you can use , since they launched it I liked it a lot and thanks to its new updates it allows the design process to be very easy.

We use XAML to create amazing interfaces, now if they are? In my view it was always feasible to create beautiful interfaces, the only detail is that there was no clear knowledge, you can guide yourself with the Adobe XD or Zeplin project, here is Have a lot of patience, do not despair and do it calmly so that your interfaces look like the prototype and get the expected result.

The “BlogPage” design has an intermediate difficulty, but thanks to Grid and CollectionView we can structure it better, first we create layers with the help of two Grids, in the parent Grid add PancakeView with their respective gradients allowing to occupy the entire interface, in the son grid encapsulate the BackgroundImage2.png image and its Labels, add another independent Grid encapsulating a ScrollView with a parent StackLayout, and within it, two StackLayout for each horizontal and vertical collectionView.

Focusing on the CollectionViews, to give it that aspect of homogeneous separation, I used the StackLayout Father and son and with the properties of “Padding” and “Margin” you can get the following result.

The “DescriptionBlogPage” design has the same logic as “BlogPage”, adding two Grids, the parent Grid with PancakeView and the son with three controls, the last label adds a ScrollView to display the description of the publication for the purpose that is not Move the other controls on the interface.

## Conclusions

The developers have evolved, and we are not conformist, we seek perfection, we want our software to be of quality and focused on the user experience, therefore, we learn new skills that will help us set shorter goals.

Xamarin.Forms understood that goal and I am very happy that the community in which I am a part helps us and we are always in constant innovation.
