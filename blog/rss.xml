            <description><![CDATA[That and other questions made me, and certainly the world we live in leads us to be self-taught, competition is latent, and having more than one skill makes a difference in getting a job or even a promotion, don’t you believe me? So let’s think about the most terrible thing that could happen, for example, if the only designer missed the job and at that moment the client who wants to show him the prototype of the application arrived, the project manager does not know what to do and all the responsibility falls on him, what would you do ?, maybe the Project Manager convinces him to come another day but the company would be losing reputation, another solution would be to show that you can expose the prototype, since you learned UI / UX design and thanks to your good performance against the problem you receive an increase or maybe you are the new Project Manager xd.]]></description>
