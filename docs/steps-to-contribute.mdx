### Creating publications to the `Community Blog` section

We consider this contribution the most important because it allows us to structure
the content of the documentation. Xamarin Community Guide fosters the collaborative
spirit within you.

:::important

- You must have a [`GitHub`](https://github.com/) account.
- Install the code editor of your choice ([`VS Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
  [`Vim`](https://www.vim.org/),
  [`Webstorm`](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/webstorm/),
  [`Atom`](https://atom.io/), etc ...)
- Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 12.13.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`).
  You can use nvm for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed
- Install [`Yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running `yarn --version`).
  Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the npm client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.

3. **Clone the repository.**

   :::note
   
   To make changes and preserve git history, you must clone the repository on your local
   development machine.
   
   :::
   
   In the following command, change YOUR-USERNAME to your GitHub nickname.
   
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/xamarincommunityguide.github.io.git
   ```
   <ImageZoom>
   <a
     href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MonettelliSoft/monettellisoft.github.io/XamarinCommunityGuide-Core/static/img/docs/steps_to_contribute/creating_publications_to_the_community_blog_section/img_step_3.png"
     data-fancybox
     data-caption="In the above command, change YOUR-USERNAME to your GitHub nickname">
     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MonettelliSoft/monettellisoft.github.io/XamarinCommunityGuide-Core/static/img/docs/steps_to_contribute/creating_publications_to_the_community_blog_section/img_step_3.png" />

   The following command, directs you to the repository copy.

     Clone the repository
   </p>

4. **Install the dependencies.**

   Xamarin Community Guide requires certain dependencies to work, don't worry!
   All these dependencies are handled by the _Yarn package manager_, so you only need to run
   one command
   
   ```powershell
   yarn install
   ```
   
   :::caution
   
   Computers using ARM architecture (for example: Mac with M1) may have problems installing
   dependencies, this is because the sass-style preprocessor is not fully adapted for that type
   of architecture yet.

     Install the dependencies
   </p>

   ---

5. **Run the project.**

   Yarn provides a command to start a server and restart the site as soon as you
   make any changes to the project source code, you can access the site from your browser
   by visiting the URL **_http://localhost:3000/_** (default).
   
   :::tip
   
   To make the changes, use your favorite code editor, preferably **Visual Studio Code**.
   
   :::
   
   ```powershell
   yarn start
   ```
   <video width="99%" controls={true}>
   <source src="/videos/docs/steps_to_contribute/creating_publications_to_the_community_blog_section/video_step_5.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
   </video>
   <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '.8rem', margin: '6px 0px 20px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
     Run the project
   </p>

6. **In the blog folder, in the author.yml file, add your public data as a contributor.**

   ```powershell {4}
   xamarincommunityguide.github.io
   ├── blog

   │   └── authors.yml
   └── ...
   ```
   
   ```yml

   <video width="99%" controls={true}>
   <source src="/videos/docs/steps_to_contribute/creating_publications_to_the_community_blog_section/video_step_6.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

7. **In the blog folder, create an MDX file, and add the date and name
   of your post separated by hyphens and in lower case.**

   ```powershell {3,4}
   xamarincommunityguide.github.io
   ├── blog
   │   ├── 2021-08-05-my-first-post.mdx
   │   ├── 2021-09-22-my-second-post.mdx
   │   └── ...
   └── ...
   ```

   ---

8. **At the top of your publication, add the front matter block,
   followed by the imported components.**

   ```md
   ---
   slug: my-first-post
   title: My first post
   authors: [nickname]
   tags: [Tag1, Tag2, Tag3]
   ---
   
   import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';
   import ImageZoom from '/src/components/imageZoom/fancybox.js';
   import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';
   import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
   import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
   import BrowserWindow from '/src/components/BrowserWindow/browserWindow.tsx';
   import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';
   ```
   
   :::caution
   
   - For better navigation, the description of the `slug` has to be identical
     to the file of its publication.
   - Make sure to add your created `nickname` in the `authors` description.
   - In the `tags`, in addition to those that represent your publication,
     add if it is in `Spanish` or `English`.
   
   :::

9. **Main structure of the publication.**

   Xamarin Community Guide made two post templates:
   
   - [Post Template](post-template): It is a group of components that you can use to enrich
     your publication.
   
   - [My first post](my-first-post): It is a concept of how your post should be.
