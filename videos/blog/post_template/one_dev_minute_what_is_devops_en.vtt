00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.235
>> Now, what is DevOps?

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.500
Well, the funny thing about,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.720
when you say,"What is DevOps,"
you ask 10 people what

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.255
DevOps is you're probably going
to get 20 different answers.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:15.975
But at Microsoft, DevOps means
something very specific to us.

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:19.885
DevOps is the union
of people, process,

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:21.720
and products to enable

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.305
the continuous delivery of
value to our end-users.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:28.055
Now, notice I said that
really, really carefully.

00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:29.735
The reason why is because,

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:32.360
well one of them, that definition
was created by my manager.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.190
So if I get that wrong [NOISE].

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.880
The other thing is
because every word of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.190
that was designed very specifically.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.665
The key is we want to continuously
deliver value to our end-users,

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:47.480
and this vital in today's world.
